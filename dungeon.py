# The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.

# The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

# Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

# To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

# Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

# Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.


class Solution:
    def calculateMinimumHP(self, dungeon: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(dungeon), len(dungeon[0])
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        dp[m][n - 1] = dp[m - 1][n] = 1

        for i in reversed(range(m)):
            for j in reversed(range(n)):
                need = min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]) - dungeon[i][j]
                dp[i][j] = max(1, need)

        return dp[0][0]
